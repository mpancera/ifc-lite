/**
 * THE QUOTE/LINE COUPLING CHECK, split out of `validate-findings.mjs` because
 * that file crossed its size budget, not because this stopped belonging there.
 *
 * A finding from the reviewer names a `quote` (the evidence) and a `line` (where
 * it claims that evidence lives). These four functions are the whole machinery
 * `validate-findings.mjs` uses to hold those two claims to the same diff: is the
 * quote the text of some line of the patch at all (`quotableLines`,
 * `quoteAppearsIn`), and does the claimed line number actually fall inside the
 * lines the PR added (`lineIsAdded`, `addedLinesMatching`)? Re-exported from
 * `validate-findings.mjs` so every existing import path is unchanged.
 */

// The SAME walker `addedLineRanges` is built on, not a second hand-rolled one.
// A per-finding check that re-derived new-file line numbers on its own would be
// exactly the failure this file exists to close one layer up: two things that
// must agree, computed twice, agreeing with each other only until a hunk that
// does not start at line 1 shows they never did. See `addedLinesMatching` below.
import { newFileLines } from './build-review-input.mjs';
// The SAME classifier `newFileLines` uses (#3802). Two independent answers to
// "is this line a file header" is the shape one layer up from the one this file
// exists to close.
import { unifiedDiffLineKind } from '../lib/unified-diff.mjs';
// Paths reach a log the workflow greps with anchored patterns, and a git path may
// contain any byte but NUL and `/` -- a newline included. `sanitizePath`'s
// whitespace collapse is what stops one forging a reason line (see below).
import { sanitizePath } from './lib/finding-sanitizers.mjs';

 * The lines of a unified diff a quote may legitimately come from, each with its

 * the hunk header or the `+++ b/path` line, none of which require having read any

/**
 * The COUPLING CHECK: new-file line numbers of `patch`'s ADDED lines whose
 * text -- trimmed the same way `quotableLines` trims -- equals `quote` trimmed.
 *
 * ADDED lines only, on purpose. `newFileLines` also numbers context and removed
 * lines, and a quote that matches one of those is not evidence the PR added
 * anything at that line -- `lineIsAdded` would refuse it anyway, but this stays
 * consistent with that gate rather than silently accepting a wider set here.
 *
 * AMBIGUOUS CASES, decided:
 *   - THE QUOTE APPEARS MORE THAN ONCE (two added lines with identical text,
 *     e.g. two blank `return null;` guards). Both line numbers come back here;
 *     the caller does not have to pick one, because it already has a claimed
 *     `f.line` to check membership against. Matching AT a specific line is what
 *     makes "appears somewhere" ambiguity irrelevant -- the finding is valid
 *     exactly when its own claimed line is one of the matches, whichever line
 *     that is.
 *   - WHITESPACE / INDENTATION. Trimmed on both sides, same as `quotableLines`
 *     and `newFileLines` -- a quote is not disqualified by re-indentation, and
 *     was never required to reproduce it.
 *   - A QUOTE SPANNING MULTIPLE LINES. Never matches: `newFileLines` yields one
 *     row per source line, so a multi-line `quote` cannot equal any single
 *     row's `text`. This is the same behaviour `quotableLines` already had --
 *     a multi-line quote never matched a single element of that array either --
 *     so nothing here is loosened or tightened by not special-casing it.
 *   - THE QUOTE DOES NOT APPEAR AT ALL. Returns `[]`, and the caller drops the
 *     finding with "quote is not the text of any added line".
 *
 * @param {string} patch
 * @param {string} quote
 * @returns {number[]}

 * THE SEARCH IS OVER ADDED LINES, not `quoteAppearsIn`. That helper answers "is
 * this a line of the patch", CONTEXT and REMOVED lines included -- text the PR
 * did not add. Naming a file on that basis produces a CONFIDENT remedy pointing
 * at the wrong hunk ("the correct `riskiest_change.path` is X" about a line X
 * never added), which is worse for the one corrective retry than the plain
 * refusal it falls back to. `addedLinesMatching` is the predicate the
