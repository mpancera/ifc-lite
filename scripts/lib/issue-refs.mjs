/**
 * The accepted secondary shape for `scripts/check-issue-queue.mjs` (#4147):
 * a PR that REFERENCES a `ready` issue with a non-closing keyword, instead of
 * falsely claiming `Closes`, still passes the gate.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `closingIssuesReferences` -- the gate's primary and
 * preferred signal -- is populated ONLY by a closing keyword (Closes/Fixes/
 * Resolves and their synonyms). A PR that is deliberately a SLICE of a larger
 * issue cannot honestly use one of those without also claiming to finish work
 * it did not finish, and `closingIssuesReferences` auto-closes the issue at
 * merge time. Five PRs hit this on 2026-09-08 in one evening, all correctly
 * refusing to lie, all needing a manual `unqueued` waiver that says the
 * opposite of the truth (`unqueued` means "did not need to wait for the
 * queue"; the truth was "waited, was approved, is proceeding in slices").
 *
 * WHY A BODY REGEX IS SAFE HERE WHEN IT WAS REJECTED FOR THE CLOSING CASE.
 * `check-issue-queue.mjs`'s own header (PART 1) explains at length why a body
 * regex must never stand in for `closingIssuesReferences`: GitHub's own
 * keyword scanner has no notion of negation, and #2978 proved a body regex
 * disagrees with the real link in both directions. That argument is about
 * REPLACING the authoritative field. This module does not replace it -- a PR
 * that closes a `ready` issue still passes on that alone, before any of this
 * runs. What follows is consulted ONLY when `closingIssuesReferences` closes
 * nothing, and it can only WIDEN a fail into a pass, never narrow a pass into
 * a fail, and only for issues independently confirmed OPEN and `ready` by the
 * gate's normal, authorised-applier label check. A false positive here costs
 * nothing worse than a PR that should have needed `unqueued` instead getting a
 * pass it was already one label away from -- not an issue closing itself out
 * from under a sentence that denied it.
 *
 * THE KEYWORD SET is deliberately narrow and deliberately NOT the GitHub
 * closing set: `Refs`, `References`, `Part of`, `Towards` (all case
 * insensitive). Anything using `Closes`/`Fixes`/`Resolves` is already read
 * from `closingIssuesReferences` and never reaches this module.
 *
 * A MATCH REQUIRES INTENT, NOT JUST THE WORD. A body regex over free text
 * finds `Refs #12` wherever the four letters happen to sit -- inside a
 * fenced code block quoting someone else's commit message, inside an inline
 * code span, inside a `>` quoted reply, or as an ordinary verb ("this
 * function refs #12 in a loop"). None of those carry the author's intent to
 * name a queue entry, and because this module can only WIDEN a fail into a
 * pass (see above), a match with no intent behind it is not a conservative
 * false positive -- it is a live bypass of the entire queue gate for ANY PR
 * that happens to quote a `ready` issue number in a code sample or a reply.
 * `stripNonProse` removes the three container shapes that are never intent
 * (fence / span / quote) and `REF_KEYWORD_RE` then requires the keyword to
 * START its line (optionally after a list marker), which is how every real
 * `Refs #N` in this repo is actually written and which also rejects the
 * mid-sentence verb case without a second special rule for it.
 *
 * NOT A MARKDOWN PARSER. This is a scoped pre-pass, matching the gate's own
 * convention of staying dependency-light: it recognises exactly the three
 * shapes above by their line-level markers, not the full CommonMark grammar
 * (a markdown link's display text, for instance, is left alone -- narrower
 * scope than "ignore everything that isn't plain prose" but enough to close
 * the confirmed hole without a new dependency).
 */

/**
 * Strips the three markdown container shapes that never carry authorial
 * intent for a reference, so `REF_KEYWORD_RE` never sees inside them:
 *
 *  - fenced code blocks, ``` or ~~~, across lines
 *  - inline code spans, `single backticks`
 *  - blockquote lines, optional leading whitespace then `>`
 *
 * Replaces stripped text with spaces (fences/spans) or blanks out the whole
 * line (blockquotes) rather than deleting it, so line boundaries -- which
 * `REF_KEYWORD_RE`'s `^` anchor depends on -- are preserved exactly; nothing
 * downstream of a strip can accidentally glue two lines into one that now
 * starts with a keyword it never did.
