///
/// The two layouts get SEPARATE namespaces (`-parquet-v5` / `-parquet-v6`,

/// handed every client -- including one pinned to a `@ifc-lite/server-client`
/// that predates #3888 -- a freshly generated v6 blob it decodes without error
/// and draws wrong. Two namespaces plus an opt-in signal means a client that
/// did not ask for the shared layout can never be served it, from cache or
/// from a live parse, and the two entries coexist instead of evicting each
/// other on every request.
