//! Rotation-aware instancing, shared by both Parquet transports (issues #3575,
//! #3888).
//!
//! The ONE place that groups occurrences by representation identity, verifies
//! each occurrence's derived rigid placement against its own baked geometry,
//! and converts a verified placement into the Y-up origin + rotation a table
//! emits. Split out of `parquet_optimized.rs` when it was `/optimized`-only;
//! a sibling of both writers since the flat route started sharing shapes, so
//! the module neither transport owns is not named after either of them.
