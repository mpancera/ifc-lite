//! Spatial hierarchy extraction.

//! Split across three files (#3965 follow-up, to stay under the module-size
//! ratchet): this file builds the relationship maps (`canonical_parent`,
//! `spatial_children_map`, `element_containment_map`) and drives the
//! orphan-fill pass; `spatial_tree.rs` walks those maps into `SpatialNode`s
//! with the cycle/depth guards; `spatial_elevation.rs` reads
//! `IfcBuildingStorey.Elevation`. `spatial_tests.rs` stays attached to this
//! file and exercises functions from all three via `use super::*` plus the
//! re-exports below.
