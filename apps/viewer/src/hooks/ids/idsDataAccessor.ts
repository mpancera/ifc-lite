/**
 * IDS Data Accessor — thin wrapper around the canonical bridge.
 *
 * The actual `IfcDataStore → IFCDataAccessor` translation lives in
 * `@ifc-lite/ids/bridge` so the viewer, the buildingSMART corpus harness
 * (`packages/ids/src/__corpus__/corpus.test.ts`) and the MCP server share
 * one implementation. Keeping this file as
 * a re-export preserves the existing import path for callers that
 * pass through `_modelId` (currently unused but preserved for API
 * stability — the validator already takes a `modelInfo` separately).
 *
 * `mutationView`, when passed, layers any pending property edits (e.g. an
 * IDS correction applied through `MutablePropertyView.setProperty`, #3929)
 * on top of the store's own data — so a re-run of validation against THIS
 * accessor actually sees the correction instead of the pre-edit value.
 * Every other read (attributes, classifications, materials, partOf) is
 * untouched; only property reads consult the overlay.

/**
 * Build the bridge's property-overlay resolver from a `MutablePropertyView`.
 * Only property mutations with a scalar value are projected — list/array
 * property values aren't part of this overlay's contract and are skipped
 * rather than mis-rendered.
 *
 * `getMutationsForEntity()` (`mutationHistory`) is used ONLY to enumerate
 * WHICH (psetName, propName) pairs this entity has ever touched — history is
 * append-only (undo re-applies the inverse mutation with `skipHistory=true`
 * "to avoid polluting mutation history", `mutationSlice.ts`, so it never
 * pops), but the identity of a touched key never becomes wrong, only stale.
 * The actual current state/value for each key comes from
 * `MutablePropertyView.getPropertyMutation()` — the live overlay map
 * (`propertyMutations`), same source `hasChanges()` / `getModifiedEntityCount()`
 * read instead of history, for the same reason. Reading `mutation.newValue`
 * straight from history here was the bug: after an undo, the live overlay
 * had reverted but this resolver still reported the pre-undo (corrected)
 * value as an active override, so IDS re-validation kept reporting PASS on
 * data that had actually reverted to failing.
