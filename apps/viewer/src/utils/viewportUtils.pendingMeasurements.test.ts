/**
 * #2641 review defect: `hasPendingMeasurements` (Viewport.tsx) gated the
 * animation loop's per-frame `updateMeasurementScreenCoords` reprojection
 * pass on `measurements.length` / `activeMeasurement` only. With
 * polyline-only state (an in-progress click sequence, or a finished
 * polyline and nothing else) the gate returned false and the reprojection
 * pass never ran at all — so placed polyline points, segments and labels
 * froze at their click-time screen position while orbiting.
 *
 * `hasPendingMeasurementState` is the extracted, directly-testable gate
 * predicate; Viewport.tsx's `hasPendingMeasurements` calls it against the
 * live store state.
