/**
 * Anchor resolution for tour steps and screenflow beats.
 *
 * The sidebar is single-tenant, so an anchor inside an inactive panel does
 * not exist in the DOM yet - the retry loop is what distinguishes "panel is
 * still mounting after prepare()" from real rot. Panels living in another OS
 * window (pop-out) are re-docked first: a main-document overlay cannot
 * spotlight another window.
 *
 * The parameter is the anchor/panel PAIR rather than a whole step, because a
 * screenflow beat needs exactly the same resolution and is not a tour step.
 * Nothing here ever read anything else off the step.
