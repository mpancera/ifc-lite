/**
 * Spatial-structure relations for an extracted subset: which ones join it, and
 * what text each one emits.
 *
 * `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` is one-to-MANY, and a real exporter
 * writes exactly ONE of them per storey, naming every product in that storey.
 * An all-or-nothing rule (keep the relation only when every id it mentions is
 * kept) therefore drops containment on ANY strict subset of a real model: the
 * extracted products land outside the spatial tree and a viewer shows the
 * storey with nothing under it. So the `RelatedElements` SET is rewritten down
 * to the kept members instead of the relation being dropped.
 *
 * The no-dangling-reference invariant is unchanged: every `#id` in an emitted
 * record is an id the subset keeps, and since #4128 the caller's forward
 * closure keeps only ids the file DEFINES, so kept implies defined. That covers
 * the ids this module CHOOSES; it does not cover the references inside a kept
 * record, which are emitted verbatim, so a source file that already dangles
 * still dangles. That is the rest of the rules:
 *   - the RELATING object (`RelatingStructure` / `RelatingObject`, the spatial
 *     parent) is a hard requirement. A containment with no parent is
 *     meaningless, and it would dangle. A KNOWN residual gap follows from that,
 *     and it is not this module's to close: `buildSubset` force-keeps only
 *     `IfcProject` / `IfcSite` / `IfcBuilding` / `IfcBuildingStorey`, so a
 *     product contained in an `IfcSpace` or `IfcSpatialZone` still has an
 *     unkept parent and still loses containment. Widening that type list is the
 *     wrong close, because it force-keeps every space AND its forward closure in
 *     every extraction; the right one is a BACKWARD closure from each kept
 *     product up its containment and aggregation edges, which keeps exactly the
 *     seeds' ancestors and needs no type list at all. Either way it is a change
 *     to how `buildSubset` seeds, not to the rule here. Filed as #4124.
 *   - an empty intersection drops the relation.
 *   - every other non-set reference must be kept too. That is attribute 1,
 *     `OwnerHistory`; usually it already is, because each kept product's own
 *     body names the same shared `IfcOwnerHistory` and the products' forward
 *     closure keeps it. An exporter that writes a PER-RELATIONSHIP
 *     `IfcOwnerHistory` referenced by nothing else hits this rule every time,
 *     and dropping there was the orphaned-storey symptom again (#4126). This
 *     function still takes no `parsed`, so it cannot close over such a
 *     reference; it REPORTS it in {@link SpatialRelationPlan.blockedOn} and the
 *     caller, which does have `parsed`, keeps it and replans. Purity is intact:
 *     `blockedOn` is a finding, not a mutation.
 *
 * A KNOWN gap: {@link keepWhole}, the fallback for a record this module could
 * not read as its six attributes, still drops on the same private
 * `OwnerHistory` and reports nothing. That is deliberate. Its references are
 * read off the raw body with no established string boundaries, so a `#6` it
 * names may be text rather than a reference, and forward-closing over it would
 * re-create the hash-in-a-Name bug the scanner exists to avoid.
 *
 * A relation that loses NO member re-emits its source line verbatim, so an
 * extraction that happened to keep every member does not churn.
 *
 * ## What this module re-implements, and why
 *
 * Three things here already exist in `@ifc-lite/export`, and all three are
 * copied for ONE reason: that package's `exports` map exposes only `.`, and its
 * `index.ts` re-exports none of them, so reaching any of them would mean adding
 * a published export (and an `api-surface` entry) to a v4.0.0 package in order
 * to fix a CLI bug.
 *
 *   - `filterHiddenRefsFromRelationshipLine` (`reference-collector.ts`) is the
 *     same job, done better: it filters EVERY parenthesised attribute of ANY
 *     `IFCREL*` line against an `isExcluded` predicate, so it needs no slot
 *     table at all, and it carries an edge case this module has no equivalent
 *     of (`IfcRelConnectsStructuralMember`'s optional trailing placement).
 *     Adopting it would delete most of this file. The export barrier above is
 *     the whole reason it is not adopted here, and nothing else: fed only
 *     today's three types it would change no behaviour, because the CALLER
 *     picks which lines it sees. Widening the type set is the separate decision,
 *     and that is the one that changes which relations survive an extraction.
 *     Consolidation follow-up: #4125.
 *   - `splitTopLevelStepArguments` (`step-argument-parser.ts`): see
 *     {@link splitTopLevelArgs}.
 *   - `STRUCTURE_RELATIONS` (`merged-empty-containers.ts`): three lines, see
 *     below.

 *     loses that comma in the output; a five-attribute one is rejected by the
